This folder contain 7 files of python scripts and 1 file of text called 'matrix.txt'

I'll explain the purpose of each file

and each row with new line ( enter) ... PLEASE don't leave any empty spaces or new lines with no numbers on it
and each line has to have same count of numbers

1. adjacency.py this file contain 4 classes 
	
	a-) Point class represent the point with x,y and value
	b-)NeighborMatrix class to calculate the neighbors as matrix with x and y params
	c-) NeighborPoint class to calculate the neighbors as points which we will use in this project
	d-) AdjacencyPoint class to calculate adjacency of certain point given the vector , x and y of this point

2. main.py : main file to run this application in cmd and it's self explained
3. main_gui.py : main file to run this application in GUI build using Tkinter libs
4.5.6.7.[select_agecencies.py ,select_neighbors.py , neighbor_gui.py ,adjacency_gui.py]
	DO NOT RUN THIS FILE this file will be fired from the main_gui if necessary
